information source. More restrictive licences should also be based on open standard licences,
such as https://creativecommons.org/licenses/ to maximise interoperability across borders.

Glossary
Data and Information
Data and Information resources protected by copyright and offered for use under the terms of
this licence. The scope of resources covered under Regulation 2 on Interpretations of the
amended regulations.

Data Protection
Data protection legislation protects privacy rights of individuals in relation to the processing
of their personal data.
When published openly, datasets must not identify individuals.

Anonymisation and Aggregation
Anonymisation and aggregation can be used to ensure that datasets relating to human subjects
comply with relevant data protection legislation before publication.
Anonymisation involves the redaction of information from a dataset where individuals could
previously have been identified. “Sufficiently anonymised” means irrevocable anonymisation
of personal data which puts it outside data protection requirements as the data can no longer
be linked to an individual and therefore cannot be considered to be personal data.
Aggregation involves the publication of a dataset in summary form to exclude personal
information which would allow an individual to be identified.

Copyright
Copyright is an area of Intellectual Property law which covers original creative works
including literary, dramatic, musical and artistic works, film, sound recordings, broadcasts and
the typographical arrangement of published editions, computer software and non-original
databases, and performances. Copyright exists from the moment the work is created, and does
not require any registration of the work. In the case of a dataset, copyright may belong to an
employer, a government department, a funder or another party, depending on the contract
surrounding the creation of the data.

Licence
Licensing allows copyright owners to permit approved use and reuse of their work, without
relinquishing copyright fully. Licensing can permit both commercial and non-commercial
reuse of a work, depending on the terms of the licence, and licences may last in perpetuity or
for a specified period. The application of a licence does not mean that a copyright statement
should not be applied to a work, and many licences such as Creative Commons suggest that
the copyright holder is credited. Open Data is usually associated with an Open Licence such as
CC-BY (Creative Commons Attribution Only) or a Publication Domain Dedication such as
CC0.
